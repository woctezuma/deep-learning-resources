# Deep Learning Resources

Books, courses and videos, mostly about Deep Learning.

## Books

-   [Goodfellow, Ian, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville. Deep learning. MIT press, 2016.](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/),

>  The Deep Learning textbook is a resource intended to help students and practitioners enter the field of machine learning in general and deep learning in particular. The online version of the book is now complete and will remain available online for free. 

-   [Chollet, Francois. Deep Learning with Python. Manning Publications, 2017.](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python).

> Deep Learning with Python introduces the field of deep learning using the Python language and the powerful Keras library. Written by Keras creator and Google AI researcher François Chollet, this book builds your understanding through intuitive explanations and practical examples.

## Courses

-   [CS228: Probabilistic Graphical Models](https://ermongroup.github.io/cs228-notes/),

> This course starts by introducing probabilistic graphical models from the very basics and concludes by explaining from first principles the variational auto-encoder, an important probabilistic model that is also one of the most influential recent results in deep learning.

-   [CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/).

> Computer Vision has become ubiquitous in our society, with applications in search, image understanding, apps, mapping, medicine, drones, and self-driving cars. Core to many of these applications are visual recognition tasks such as image classification, localization and detection. Recent developments in neural network (aka “deep learning”) approaches have greatly advanced the performance of these state-of-the-art visual recognition systems. This course is a deep dive into details of the deep learning architectures with a focus on learning end-to-end models for these tasks, particularly image classification. During the 10-week course, students will learn to implement, train and debug their own neural networks and gain a detailed understanding of cutting-edge research in computer vision. The final assignment will involve training a multi-million parameter convolutional neural network and applying it on the largest image classification dataset (ImageNet). We will focus on teaching how to set up the problem of image recognition, the learning algorithms (e.g. backpropagation), practical engineering tricks for training and fine-tuning the networks and guide the students through hands-on assignments and a final course project. Much of the background and materials of this course will be drawn from the ImageNet Challenge.

-   [Advanced Deep Learning & Reinforcement Learning. University College London, 2018.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqYmG7hTraZDNJre23vqCGIVpfZ_K2RZs),

> This course, taught originally at UCL and recorded for online access, has two interleaved parts that converge towards the end of the course. One part is on machine learning with deep neural networks, the other part is about prediction and control using reinforcement learning. The two strands come together when we discuss deep reinforcement learning, where deep neural networks are trained as function approximators in a reinforcement learning setting.
The deep learning stream of the course will cover a short introduction to neural networks and supervised learning with TensorFlow, followed by lectures on convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, end-to-end and energy-based learning, optimization methods, unsupervised learning as well as attention and memory. Possible applications areas to be discussed include object recognition and natural language processing.
The reinforcement learning stream will cover Markov decision processes, planning by dynamic programming, model-free prediction and control, value function approximation, policy gradient methods, integration of learning and planning, and the exploration/exploitation dilemma. Possible applications to be discussed include learning to play classic board games as well as video games.
